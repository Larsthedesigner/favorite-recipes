   <h2>Description and Ingredients</h2>
         <p>This oven-baked salmon with cabbage is a simple yet flavorful dish that's perfect for a quick and healthy weeknight dinner. The salmon is moist and tender, while the cabbage becomes deliciously caramelized in the oven, offering a sweet and savory contrast to the fish. Seasoned with garlic, paprika, and thyme, this dish is bursting with flavor and nutrients. Plus, it's easy to prepare and requires minimal cleanup, making it a fuss-free meal option. Serve it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for a bright and zesty finish.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>4 salmon fillets (about 6 ounces each), skin-on or skinless</li>
            <li>1 small green cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
          </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Place the thinly sliced cabbage on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle with minced garlic, paprika, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Toss everything together until the cabbage is evenly coated with the seasonings.</li>
            <li>Push the cabbage to the edges of the baking sheet, creating space for the salmon fillets in the center. Arrange the salmon fillets on the baking sheet, skin-side down if they have skin. Drizzle the remaining olive oil over the salmon and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, and the cabbage is tender and slightly caramelized around the edges.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve the baked salmon and cabbage hot, garnished with fresh parsley and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the fish. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
