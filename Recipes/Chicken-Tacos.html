    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs in the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the bone broth, chopped onion, minced garlic, chili powder, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Pour this mixture over the chicken in the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours, until the chicken is tender and easily shreds with a fork.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, use two forks to shred it directly in the slow cooker, allowing it to absorb the flavorful broth.</li>
            <li>Warm the corn tortillas either on a dry skillet or in the microwave.</li>
            <li>To assemble the tacos, spoon some of the shredded chicken onto each warm corn tortilla.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite toppings such as shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, diced avocado, salsa, sour cream, a squeeze of lime juice, and fresh cilantro.</li>
            <li>Serve the chicken tacos immediately and enjoy!</li>
