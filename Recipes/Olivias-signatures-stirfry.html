            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
            <li>1 carrot, julienned</li>
            <li>1 cup snap peas, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for stir-frying)</li>
            <li>Cooked rice or noodles, for serving</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing the tofu. Cut the pressed tofu into cubes or slices, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut aminos, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger to make the stir-fry sauce. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the tofu cubes/slices in a single layer and cook until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the tofu from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more vegetable oil if needed. Add the sliced bell peppers, broccoli florets, julienned carrot, and snap peas. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
            <li>Return the cooked tofu to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour the prepared stir-fry sauce over the tofu and vegetables. Toss everything together until well coated in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and the flavors to meld together.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve the tofu stir-fry hot over cooked rice or noodles. Enjoy!</li>
